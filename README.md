## Museum Maps

Let's make a better way to find exhibits, info, and the way around museums. This project aims to create an interative alternative to static pdf and pamplet maps. If we combine the simplicity of these floor plans with easy-to-access information, we can make something useful and fun. Another goal is promoting open data, to allow other civic hackers to do projects of their own.
The most basic features are a floor plan map like those in the free pamplets with labeling and color coding. With D3 much more can be built on top of that. The possibilities for additional UI features are endless, but some possible ideas include: click on room for more info or list of pieces, selecting rooms of interest or rooms visited, and linking to the digitalized archives.
